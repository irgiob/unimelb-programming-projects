gr
if
footy
is
a
religion
the
great
northern
hotel
is
its
mega
church
nestled
away
in
the
inner
north
this
sprawling
sports
pub
has
a
well
earned
reputation
as
the
premier
destination
for
locals
and
visitors
alike
to
watch
the
game
the
main
dining
area
can
feel
like
mission
control
during
the
crossover
between
dinnertime
and
the
match
thanks
to
a
massive
wall
spanning
screen
bodies
spring
up
to
roar
success
while
groans
of
despair
rumble
under
the
celebrations
if
the
main
event
isnt
to
your
liking
a
bit
of
table
real
estate
can
be
claimed
in
the
pup
friendly
beer
garden
ask
for
the
telly
to
be
changed
to
whatever
match
youre
after
and
chances
are
staff
will
be
happy
to
accommodate
the
great
northen
might
be
within
walking
distance
of
carlton
football
clubs
princes
park
heartland
but
a
variety
of
teams
are
represented
via
paraphernalia
on
the
rare
wall
space
not
occupied
by
a
telly
a
framed
poster
of
freo
gun
nat
fyfe
stretches
out
in
one
corner
a
doggies
scarf
hangs
on
the
bar
as
a
relic
of
last
years
hectic
grand
final
scene
they
also
treat
their
tap
list
like
a
coach
treats
their
starting
line
up
a
rotating
selection
of
new
and
seasonal
ales
and
pilsners
including
full
ranges
of
stone
wood
two
brothers
and
moo
brew
if
the
range
of
craft
beers
is
too
intimidating
theres
always
the
trusty
pot
of
carlton
waiting
for
a
call
up
