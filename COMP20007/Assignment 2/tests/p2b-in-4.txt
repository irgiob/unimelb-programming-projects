released

heart
mother
an
early
version
in

in
january
but
disagreements
over
the
mix
prompted
the
hiring
of
ron
geesin
to
work
out
the
sound
problems
geesin
worked
to
improve
the
score
but
with
little
creative
input
from
the
band
production
was
troublesome
geesin
eventually
completed

director
of
the
choir
hired

gilmour
said
it
was
a
neat
way
of
saying
that
he
didnt
do
anything
waters
was
critical
of
atom
heart
mother
claiming
that
he
would
prefer
if
it
were
thrown
into
the
dustbin
and
never
listened
to
by
anyone
ever
again
gilmour
was
equally
dismissive
of
the
album
and
once
described
it
as
a
load
of
rubbish
stating
i
think
we
were
scraping
the
barrel
a
bit
at
that
period

mason

recording
studio
at
his
house
in

in
a
converted

at
the
back
of
his
garden
in

upon
their
return
from
touring
atom
heart
mother
pink
floyd
began
working
on
new
material
lacking
a
central
theme
they
attempted
several
unproductive
experiments
engineer
john
leckie
described
the
sessions
as
often
beginning
in
the
afternoon
and
ending
early
the
next
morning
during
which
time
nothing
would
get
there
was
no
record
company
contact
whatsoever
except
when
their
label
manager
would
show
up
now
and
again
with
a
couple
of
bottles
of
wine
and
a
couple
of
joints
the
band
spent
long
periods
working
on
basic
sounds
or
a
guitar
riff
they
also
spent
several
days
at
air
studios
attempting
to
create
music
using
a
variety
of
household
objects
a
project
which
would
be
revisited
between
the
dark
side
of

meddle
not
only
confirms
lead
guitarist
david
gilmours
emergence
as
a
real
shaping
force
with
the
group
it
states
forcefully
and
accurately
that
the
group
is
well
into
the
growth
track

nme
called
meddle
an
exceptionally
good
album
singling
out
echoes
as
the
zenith
which
the
floyd
have
been
striving
for
however
melody
makers
michael
watts
found
it
underwhelming
calling
the
album
a
soundtrack
to
a
non
existent
movie
and
shrugging
off
pink
floyd
as
so
much
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing
meddle
is
a
transitional
album
between
the
barrett
influenced
group
of
the
late
s
and
the
emerging
pink
floyd
the
lp
peaked
at
