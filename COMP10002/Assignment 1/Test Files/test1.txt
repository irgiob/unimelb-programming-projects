Hello, what are you
      doing?

Haha, I'm writing my comp10002 programming assignment.
Its REALLY REALLY fun, because we are doing
			text processing.
.p
What that means is that whatever I write
in
this input file is going to get reformatted and presented 
neatly                 as the text output of the program (written to stdout, but can easily be captured into a file using ">" as a shell operator), 
regardless		of how

it appears in the input,
with embedded formatting commands controlling the layout.
.p
Cool, isn't it!
.p
Now, here is some more text with some other commands in it:
.b
new line one;
.b
new line two; and
.b
new line three.
.p
And a new paragraph as well, taa-dahhh!
.w 30
And now the width has been shrunk down to thirty,
whereas previously
it was at the initial default value
(see the handout for details).
Changing either the left margin or the width
always starts a new paragraph.
That means you need to be a bit careful, because...
.w 55
.l 10
 ...if both margins get changed at the same time with consecutive
commands, we don't want two blank inter-paragraph lines introduced,
we just want one.
(Note also that if you do want to have a line or paragraph that
starts with a ".", you need to remember to put an extra  space
in front of it
so that the "." does not get interpreted as a command.)
.p
.p
And note also that consecutive ".p" commands only cause a
single paragraph break to be generated.
.b
.b
.b
And the same with multiple ".b" commands in a row, they shouldn't add
additional lines. And also, be sure that, for example,
 .p combinations *not* in column one don't get accidentally processed
 				as commands!
.p
Finally, you need to correctly handle extended strings like URLs
such as
http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/ammoffat/teaching/10002/ass1/
(which is 62 characters) that are
longer than the current width supposedly allows...
