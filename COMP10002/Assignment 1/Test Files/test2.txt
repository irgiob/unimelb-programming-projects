.c Stage 3 Attempt
.p
.h 1 Heading One

This is random text that has no message and no real meaning.
It's sole purpose


is to test comp10002 assignment 1 programs.
.p
	And nothing else...
.h 2 Heading Two
It has some second level headings
.b
some ".b" commands
and some
 .p commands.
.p
.h 2 Heading         Three       
It also has more second level headings.
.p
And more paragraph breaks, even though there was no real reason to put one there, well, whatever.
.l 10
.w 30
And it has a section of text that is in much narrower margins, created using the ".l" and ".w" commands.
.l 4
.w 50
And then back to the indent that was default from the beginning, and
back also to the original text width.

.h 1 Heading Four
.h 2 Heading Five
Wow, whatever, totally exciting, not! But if your program can
			process


			this
			input
			file
then there is a reasonable chance it can process the other secret test files that will get used during the submission testing after submissions have closed.
.p
Don't forget to include the Authorship Declaration in your submission (see
https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/ammoffat/teaching/10002/ass1/ass1-skel.c
to get a copy of it), and don't forget to sign it.

.h 2 Heading Six
.h 3 Heading Seven
.h 2 Heading Eight
.h 3 Heading Nine
.h 3 Heading Ten
Plus some text that goes into that subsubsection.
.h 1 Finally
.p
Ok, whatever.
.p
.c End of Input
