    Hello, what are you doing? Haha, I'm writing my
    comp10002 programming assignment. Its REALLY
    REALLY fun, because we are doing text processing.

    What that means is that whatever I write in this
    input file is going to get reformatted and
    presented neatly as the text output of the program
    (written to stdout, but can easily be captured
    into a file using ">" as a shell operator),
    regardless of how it appears in the input, with
    embedded formatting commands controlling the
    layout.

    Cool, isn't it!

    Now, here is some more text with some other
    commands in it:
    new line one;
    new line two; and
    new line three.

    And a new paragraph as well, taa-dahhh!

    And now the width has been
    shrunk down to thirty, whereas
    previously it was at the
    initial default value (see the
    handout for details). Changing
    either the left margin or the
    width always starts a new
    paragraph. That means you need
    to be a bit careful,
    because...

          ...if both margins get changed at the same time with
          consecutive commands, we don't want two blank
          inter-paragraph lines introduced, we just want one.
          (Note also that if you do want to have a line or
          paragraph that starts with a ".", you need to remember
          to put an extra space in front of it so that the "."
          does not get interpreted as a command.)

          And note also that consecutive ".p" commands only cause
          a single paragraph break to be generated.
          And the same with multiple ".b" commands in a row, they
          shouldn't add additional lines. And also, be sure that,
          for example, .p combinations *not* in column one don't
          get accidentally processed as commands!

          Finally, you need to correctly handle extended strings
          like URLs such as
          http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/ammoffat/teaching/10002/ass1/
          (which is 62 characters) that are longer than the
          current width supposedly allows...
