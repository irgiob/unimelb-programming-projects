# PROJECT 2B: ShadowLife
### Object Oriented Software Development

This is my submission for project 2B of SWEN20003.

The code in this repository runs a simulation of actors moving fruit across different storages.

List of classes:
* AbstractActor
* Fence
* Pad
* Pool
* Sign
* AbstractMover
* Gatherer
* Thief
* AbstractStorage
* Tree
* GoldenTree
* Stockpile
* Hoard

Combined, the program can take in a world file (and tick arguments) to create a simulation. The project at this stage is complete.
