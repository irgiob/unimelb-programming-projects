# SWEN20003 Project 1

This is the Gitlabs page for my submission for Project 1 of the Object-Oriented Software Development class at 
the University of Melbourne

Program Classes/Interfaces:
* ShadowLife: Main class
* World: Class containing all actors and background
* AbstractActor: Abstract class for all actor types
* Gatherer: Actor subclass for moving actor
* Tree: Actor subclass for stationary actor
* Background: Class contains and draws background image
* Drawable: Interface for drawable objects 

All tasks have been completed, and the program runs successfully. Multiple steps have been taken so that the program is 
easily expandable for future actor types using the Abstract Actor class.
