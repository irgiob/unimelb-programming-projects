# unimelb-programming-projects
A compilation of all the programming assignments and tasks I did across my Software Engineering degree at the University of Melbourne

### Subjects Included
- COMP10001 (Foundations of Computing)
- COMP10002 (Foundations of Algorithms)
- COMP20007 (Design of Algorithms)
- COMP20008 (Elements of Data Processing)
- SWEN20003 (Object-Oriented Software Development)
- COMP30023 (Computer Systems)
- COMP30024 (Artificial Intelligence)
- SWEN30006 (Software Modelling & Design)
- INFO30005 (Web Information Technologies)
- SWEN90004 (Modelling Complex Software Systems)
- SWEN90007 (Software Design & Architecture)

note: only specifications, mark-schemes, test/input files, and programming components are included in this repository. Non-programming parts of the assignments (such as reports and reflections) have not been included. Some assignments (specifically for project-based subjects) may have their own repositories, and so won't be included here (please checkout the rest of my GitHub profile to find these).
